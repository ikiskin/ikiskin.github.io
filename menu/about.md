I joined as a lecturer in AI for Multimodal Health Monitoring at the Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence in January 2022. I obtained my PhD in acoustic machine learning with the Machine Learning Research Group of the University of Oxford, as part of the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems CDT. I obtained a first-class honours MEng degree at the University of Oxford in 2015.
### Research Highlights

My interests include Bayesian deep learning, acoustical and multimodal signal processing.

I have jointly led a feasibility study of COVID classification from acoustic data in collaboration with UKHSA and the Alan Turing Institute as part of the [Turing Royal Statistical Society Health Data Lab](https://mobile.twitter.com/turingrss_hdlab). A publication highlight includes an overview discussing the limitations of current studies: COVID-19 detection from audio: seven grains of salt [[paper]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00141-2/fulltext). Further large-scale studies are currently under review.

As part of the HumBug project, I have been leading the development of machine learning acoustic monitoring solutions for mosquito recognition for the purpose of data-driven approaches to malaria prevention. From this collaboration, my most notable achievements are:

* DCASE 2022 Task 5: Few-shot Bioacoustic Event Detection co-organiser [[website]](https://dcase.community/challenge2022/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07911)
* ACM 2022 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge (ComParE) co-organiser: Mosquito Event Detection [[website]](http://www.compare.openaudio.eu/2022-2/) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06799) [[code]](https://github.com/EIHW/ComParE2022/tree/MOS-C)
* Best paper award at NeurIPS 2019 Machine Learning for the Developing World Workshop [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04733)
* NeurIPS 2021 dataset and benchmark paper [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07607) [[reviews]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vhjsBtq9OxO)
* Leading a collaboration with the MIDS programme at UC Berkeley, resulting in state-of-the-art performance [[website]](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/Project-VecNet/)
